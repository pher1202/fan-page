        <p> Hello, my name is Pao Her.
            <br> I am a .Net Programmer student at Hennepin Technical College.
            <br> This is my first programming course, and I'm enjoying it.
            <br> Here are some fun facts about me. </p>
        <div id="content">
            <ul>
                <li>I tore my right Anterior Crucial Ligament in 2009 playing football.</li>
                <li>I'm an Eagle Scout, the highst rank in boy scouts.</li>
                <li>I love camping, even in the snow!</li>
                <li>Watermelons. Cold watermelons. Especially in the summer.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2> Music</h2>
        <p> <span class="myParagraph">I love music. For as long as I can remember, I've always been drawn to music.  </span> It started with the flute and violin in 8th grade. The piano came natural to me and was my main instrument. The guitar was my secondary instrument. In high school, I participated in choir and sung treble and bass. Sometimes, I record my own music and publish them on Facebook. </p>
        <br>
        <p> Music helps me focus. It conforts me when I'm feeling low. At one point, I wanted to study music in college. But now it's just a hobby. No matter what though, music will always be a part of my life. </p>
