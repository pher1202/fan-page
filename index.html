<h1> Music</h1>
        <p>I love music. For as long as I can remember, I've always been drawn to music.  It started with the flute and violin in 8th grade.  The piano came natural to me and was my main instrument.  The guitar was my secondary instrument.  In high school, I participated in choir and sung treble and bass.  Sometimes, I record my own music and publish them on Facebook. </p> <br> <p> Music helps me focus.  It conforts me when I'm feeling low.  At one point, I wanted to study music in college.  But now it's just a hobby.  No matter what though, music will always be a part of my life. </p>
